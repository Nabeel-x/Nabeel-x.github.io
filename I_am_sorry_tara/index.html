    <h1>FORGIVE ME TARA</h1>
    <div class="lines">
        <p>
            I am writing this apology note to express my sincerest apologies for all the stupid things I have done to you. I know that my words, ego, stupidity and lack of maturity have deeply affected you, and I am truly sorry for the pain I have caused. I never intended to hurt you, and it pains me to know that I have done so.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want you to know that I am taking full responsibility for my actions. I have been reflecting on my behavior, and I realize that I have been selfish and inconsiderate. I have let my ego get in the way of our relationship, and I am deeply sorry for that. I understand that my words and actions have hurt you, and I am committed to making things right.
        </p>
        <p>
            I know that I have a lot of work to do to regain your trust and respect. I am willing to put in the effort to change my behavior and become a better person. I want to be the partner you deserve, and I am committed to making that happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            You been the most important person in my life. I have never really put much effort into our relationship other than just being there and empty words which I couldnt fullfill. I failed to support you when you needed me, and I failed to control my negative emotions. I have really let you down and I have disappointed you in so many ways. I am truly sorry for that.
        </p>
        <p>
            My life has been the happiest with you, and I failed to appreciate that. I want us to be back together, and I will try my best to make you feel assured and loved. I want you to be happy. I fell prey to my emotions and  I let them control me. My priorities were all wrong, I should have always put you first, but I didn't.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am truly sorry for everything. I never meant to hurt you, and I hope you can forgive me. You mean a lot to me, and I promise to do better.
